# Chess-stats

2 scripts to generate graphs representing Rating vs ACPL and Rating vs Errors using [Lichessâ€™s API](https://lichess.org/api)

# Usage

## Installing dependencies

- Optional: Create a python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) and then activate it
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Getting the data

`game_id_collector.py` gets game IDs for elo in the specified range.

```
python game_id_collector.py -l [lower elo bound for games to be collected] -h [upper elo bound for games to be collected] -n [number of games to be collected per 100 elo] -t [type of game mode]
```

`-l and -h` need to be divisible by `100` i.e. `600/700/800...` with a minimum of 600 and maximum of 2900.

`-t` should be from the following list `[0, 1, 2, 6, 3, 4, 18, 11, 12, 15 ,13 ,14 ,16, 17]` representing UltraBullet, Bullet, Blitz, Rapid, Classical, Correspondence, Crazyhouse, Chess960, King of the Hill, Three-check, Antichess, Atomic, Horde, Racing Kings

For example if you call `game_id_collector.py -l 600 -h 1000 -n 100 -t 2`. The script will collect games for 100 games for each of the following ranges: `600-700, 700-800, 800-900, 900-1000` and place them into files called `600-700-100.txt, 700-800-100.txt ....`

## Creating the graphs

`python display_stats.py` utilizes the collected game IDs to calculate ACPL and Errors.

# Common problems

This script uses `matplotlib.xkcd` which requires several special fonts. You can get them from the following two repos: [https://github.com/ipython/xkcd-font/tree/master/xkcd/build](https://github.com/ipython/xkcd-font/tree/master/xkcd/build) and [https://github.com/imkevinxu/xkcdgraphs](https://github.com/imkevinxu/xkcdgraphs).

You may need to restart your computer after installing and potentially clear [`matplotlib`'s cache](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26146780/how-to-get-xkcd-font-on-matplotlib#comment55709798_26148853)
